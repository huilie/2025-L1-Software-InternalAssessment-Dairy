                         Made from grass-fed milk, New Zealand butter is known for its rich flavor and natural golden color.As early as the mid-19th century, New Zealand exported butter to Britain. Salted butter was common to withstand long sea voyages. By the 20th century, its purity and taste earned a strong reputation in Europe.

                        Cheddar is the most iconic, offering a mild, consistent taste. In recent years, New Zealand has also developed specialty cheeses like blue cheese and brie. British settlers in the late 19th century introduced traditional cheesemaking. By the early 20th century, cheddar cheese became one of New Zealand’s most important exports.
