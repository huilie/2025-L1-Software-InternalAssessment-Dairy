                New Zealand is renowned for its pristine landscapes, fresh air, and clean water. 
                <br>
                Dairy cows graze freely on lush pastures all year round, producing milk that is naturally rich and nutritious.
                <br>
                Strict food safety and quality regulations ensure every step — from pasture to processing — meets the highest standards. 
                <br>
                New Zealand dairy consistently matches or exceeds international benchmarks for nutrition, safety, and traceability.
                <br>
                Over 95% of New Zealand’s dairy cows are grass-fed. 
                <br>
                This results in milk with higher levels of Omega-3 fatty acids, beta-carotene, and vitamin E, offering natural health benefits that global consumers value.
